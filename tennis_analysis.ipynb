Players use a strung racquet to strike a hollow rubber ball, covered with felt, over a net and into the opponent's court. The objective of the game is to play the ball in such a way that the opponent cannot play a valid return. The player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point, while the opposite player will.  \n","Tennis is played on different surfaces, including grass, clay, hard courts, and even indoor carpet. Each surface affects the ball's speed and bounce differently, leading to varied styles of play. In this project I'm investigating the relationship between the type of surface on which the match was played on to various stats (such as the duration of the match, the number of aces, etc.).  \n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","The data is taken from kaggle and is called ['Huge Tennis Database'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/tennis).
