Spanning from community courts to grand slam arenas, the game attracts millions of enthusiasts worldwide, both as participants and spectators. While the sport's beauty lies in its intricacies, one element stands out as a critical determinant of a player's success: the serve.  \n","\n","Serving in tennis is equivalent to a pitcher's throw in baseball or a quarterback's pass in football. It sets the tone for the entire point, giving the server an initial advantage. Within this domain, the first serve is particularly crucial. A powerful and accurate first serve can drastically diminish the opponent's chances of returning the ball effectively, thereby providing the server with a strategic upper hand.  \n","\n","However, it's not just about getting the ball into play. The quality of the first serve, measured by both its accuracy (percentage of successful first serves) and its effectiveness (percentage of points won on a successful first serve), can be game-changing. A higher first serve percentage indicates consistent performance, while a higher winning percentage on the first serve points reflects the serve's potency.  \n","\n","This study seeks to delve deeper into these metrics to uncover patterns and insights. Specifically, I aim to answer:  \n","1. Is there a difference between winners' and losers' first serve percentages?\n","2. Does a difference exist between winners' and losers' percentages of winning first serve points?\n","\n","By analyzing these questions, I hope to shed light on the pivotal role the first serve plays in a tennis match's outcome and potentially provide players and coaches with valuable insights to refine their strategies.  \n","\n","---\n","\n","# Data Source:\n","The data is taken from kaggle and is called ['Huge Tennis Database'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/guillemservera/tennis).
